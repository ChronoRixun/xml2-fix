// A connection to the running Discord client's local RPC pipe (\\.\pipe\discord-ipc-0..9), as its
// SDKs make one, without them: frames of [opcode][length][JSON] (discord_rules.hpp). Every read and
// write has a timeout, so a Discord that stops answering never holds its caller for long, and what
// the other end sends is held to what Discord sends (discord_rules::inbox): a peer that floods the
// pipe, or sends a frame no Discord does, is dropped at once. Used by the presence's own thread in the
// game (discord_presence.cpp) and by xml2_test, against a Discord of its own and --discord-live.
