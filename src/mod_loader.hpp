// Loads mods without touching the game's files. A mod is a folder under <game>\mods laid out
// like the game folder (e.g. mods\My Skin\actors\1101.igb); mods\load-order.txt lists which
// mods are enabled and in what order:
//
//   # later lines win when two mods contain the same file
//   +Better HUD
//   -Unused Mod           (disabled; kept in the list so its position is remembered)
//   +My Skin
//
// When the game opens, checks or searches for a file for reading, the path is redirected to
// the copy in the highest enabled mod that has one. Writes, and files no mod contains, go
// to the game folder as usual. Mods can also add files the game doesn't ship.

	// engine DLLs that read game data). Logs every access when `trace` is set.
